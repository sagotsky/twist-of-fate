The Basics
==========

Core Mechanic - Bidding
-----------------------

Twist of Fate is a diceless roleplaying game. It retains the
element of chance, though not randomness, by way of its core
mechanic - bidding. Each player has a number of skills and
attributes as well as a pool of will power points. When it comes
time to see if a character succeeds or fails, players spend a
number of points, which is added to the skill or attribute score.

This mechanic helps Twist of Fate focus on the collaborative
storytelling side of roleplaying, without detracting from the game
side. The idea is that while characters have set skills, what they
care about achieving should have an effect on the world around
them. This helps ensure that a character succeeds where he's
supposed to, rather than happening to roll a critical failure or a
botch. This in turn goes to reinforce that a character's role in
the story is the role the player wants to play.


Attributes
----------

To model a character's potential ability and talent, each character
has a set of attributes. These attributes range from 0-8 points,
where 0 is entirely nonfunctional and 8 is nearly superhuman.
Unlike other RPGs, MoMa aims to work best for characters who have a
balanced set of attributes instead of an extremely specialized
set.

Strength

    Physical brawn. This attribute is common for athletic and
    combative characters.

Agility

    Dexterity and finesse for characters who are physically
    competent without relying on brute force.

Brains

    Mental acumen. A character with brains will have book smarts
    and good reasoning ability but fall victim to frequent zombie
    attacks. *"Braaaains!"*

Social

    Charisma and people skills. This stat indicates how well your
    character interacts with others.

Health

    Your ability to not die. Unlike the other attributes, health is
    passive. It does not make you more capable or effective, but keeps
    you on your feet long enough to use your other attributes.

Magic (Optional)

   This attribute is optional and may not be present in all games.
    Spellcasting is elemental, with each of the four character stats
    corresponding to earth, fire, water, or wind.  




Skills
------

While attributes measure a character's natural abilities, skills
represent those abilities and techniques a character has practiced
and learned. Each skill is associated with an attribute. Just like
attributes, skills range from 0 to 8 points, 0 being untrained, 8
being among the best in the world.

To use a skill, add your skill score to its relevant attribute's
score. If the result matches or exceeds the difficulty number (DN)
assigned by your gamemaster, the skill succeeds. Sometimes your
skill will be used in direct opposition to another character in the
game. In these cases, instead of using a DN you make an opposed
skill check and the player with the highest result wins.

Simple, right? Also boring. Checking if attribute plus skill is
greater than a difficulty number is about as simple as skill checks
can get. It's efficient but uninteresting. Most of your skill
checks (at least the ones that your character is interested in)
will be more mechanically interesting than this. Characters have a
pool of willpower points. These can be spent during skill checks to
increase your score for that check. They will be discussed in
greater detail in the next section.



Willpower
=========

The Why of Willpower
--------------------

Some gamers find the idea of resolving conflicts using willpower
instead of dice to be questionable. Others find it downright
offensive. What follows is an explanation of the thought process
involved in coming up with MoMa.

Many moons ago, the author of this game was involved in a game of
Deadlands. Deadlands had a mechanic called fate chips. Chips could
be used to increase die rolls or escape bodily harm. If you had any
fate chips left by the end of the session you could spend them to
increase your abilities. Quite a few combats involved GM and PCs
trading stacks of chips as one side powered up their attacks and
the other evaded injury. Eventually both sides ran out of chips
combatants could die.

I borrowed this idea when I first started GMing Dungeons and
Dragons. There is no need to enumerate the myriad mechanics used in
emulating fate chips in D&D. The result was that chips could be
spent to let players fudge the dice in their character's favor,
within the bounds of the character. Knights wouldn't fall off
horses. Sly tricksters wouldn't get tongue tied. Essentially,
*fate chips allowed players to play the character they imagined, not the one the dice gave them.*

Twist of Fate seeks to provide mechanics that expand on this notion
of giving narrative control back to players. In this sense, MoMa
prioritizes collaborative storytelling over gaming or simulation.

The willpower mechanics also serve to push the focus of the game
toward interesting conflicts. For instance, look at characters
trying to climb a tree. Checking if attribute plus skill is greater
than the DN of a given tree is boring. You can skim right over it.
Either the players succeed or they don't. There is no reason to
burden this part of the game with tedious skills - it has no effect
on the narrative. If the players really want to succeed here, they
have the power to do so by spending willpower points.

Willpower is a simple mechanic. Each character has a number of
willpower points. They can be spent during skill checks after
totalling your skill, but before resolving if you succeed. In the
case of opposed skill checks, players should simultaneously reveal
how many willpower points are being spent. Points are always spent,
even on a failed check.

To make things more interesting, characters have separate pools of
willpower bound to each attribute: strength, agility, brains,
social, and (optionally) magic. The availability of these points is
determined by their attribute. They represent characters having a
little extra oomph in the area of their expertise.

Each attribute can hold a maximum of 5 {53}points. Each night of
rest restores 3 {53}points. Each meal (up to three per day)
restores 1 {53}points. So a character with 4 strength can have up
to 20 strength points at one time, regains 12 strength points each
night of rest, and 4 points at each meal. These numbers are chosen
to encourage players to spend their points instead of hoarding
them. It is expected that most encounters will require the
expenditure of willpower points.

It doesn't take a lot of math ability to realize that an average
strength character with no weapons training can spend his 20
strength points to best a brawny master with 8 strength and 8
weapon skill. For this reason, the number of willpower points spent
in one check is limited to the skill being used. This means that at
best you can double your skill in any one check. Therefore the
highest result of any check is 24 (before perks and other
shenanigans).

Because points are always spent, even on a failed check, you can end 
up with interesting game play even on the simplest of checks. Let's 
say you're trying to climb a tree to get over a wall. The tree has 
few limbs, so it's difficulty 10 to climb. You have 4 points agility 
and 2 points of athletics, for a score of 6. You try to climb at a 6 
and fail. Retry, spending a point for 7, and you still fail. For 
some odd reason probably stemming to your childhood, you really want 
to get over this tree. How many points to spend though? 2, then 3, 
and then 4 will eventually get you over but you'll have spent 10 
willpower points where 4 were needed. Skipping to a higher number 
could work, but it can also be wasteful. A simple algorithm would be 
to only use even or odd numbers. In this case, only odd would have 
you spend 1, 3, and 5 points for a total of 9. Only even would be 2 
and 4 for 6 points. On the other hand if you were severely unathletic 
and 7 points were needed, odd would cost 1, 3, 5, and 7 points - 
total 16 as opposed to 2, 4, 6, and 8 for 20 points. Now consider that 
you may not always have several rounds spent try to climb for cheap. 
Or that going over the DN may have bonus effects. If you were climbing 
the tree to escape an angry mob, wouldn't you want to climb it on your 
first try and twice as quickly as usual?  

overflow skills
---------------

Finally, there are a number of extra effects where you can spend
willpower during combat. Unlike the rest of the game these effects
do not require a skill check. More details are available in the
combat chapter. {Skills}To represent the initial learning curve in
picking up a new skill, before any points can be invested in the
skill a specialization must be purchased. This is reversed from how
specializations usually work in RPGs, in that you buy as many
points in a skill as are economical and then pick up the specialty
to go above and beyond those points. Instead in this system the
specialization is representative of the character's starting point
that serves as the basis for the rest of the skill. Specializations
are listed after each skill name, in parentheses.

Multiple specializations may be purchased over time. The number of
specializations you can have in a given skill is limited to the
number of points in that skill.

Strength Skills
---------------

* Athletics (Climb, Swim, Throw, Lift) 
* Weapon (Bladed, polearm, bludgeon, two handed, gun, bow, fist) 
* Brawl/Grapple (hand to hand.  specialty for punching or grappling) 
* Carry (does carry in stones work? are there specializations for carry?) 
* shield (important enoug that it gets its own. how would shield specialties work?)

Agility Skills
--------------

* Acrobatics (Tumble, Balance, jump, run) 
* Dodge 
* Subterfuge (hide, silence, trackless step) 
* blue collar? 
* vehicle (horse, car, boat, tank) 
* illicit (pickpocket, pick lock, holdout) 
* drive (ride/pilot/drive) 
* ranged weapons (is thrown a spec or separate?)

Brains Skills
-------------

Medicine (first aid, surgery, anatomy, pharmacy) 
* Science (Alchemy, Computers, whatever else fits) 
* Academics (any school subject.  potential for further specialization) 
* Knowledge (occult, legal, etc) (how is this different from academics) 
* Language (obviously this one will be a big abstraction. maybe making the skill into a general linguistics thing but each specialty buys a language?  one specialty per dot?)
* Survival (tracking, camping, hunting) 
* white collar

Social Skills
-------------

* Act (Character, Posture, Stage, Oratory) 
* Manipulate (Lie, pressure, manipulate, convince, pry, command, evade, intimidate, dip (compromise instead?) story?) (split this skill. deception and
straightforwardness maybe?) 
* Meet (Befriend, Chat, Gossip, Flirt, black market, connections?) 
* Scrutinize (Detect lies, observe) where does etiquette go? (culture?) 
* culture 
* lead

(linguistics is a special case. language skill buys scholastic
knowledge. culture buys folk knowledge, letting people communicate
as though they were locals. culture can have other values too.)

Flaws and Perks
===============

Characters are more than their attributes and
skills. They have loves and fears. Flaws and perks serve to make
characters more interesting by giving them more flavor than their
ability stats.

Combat
======

Combat Effects
--------------

Additional combat effects were mentioned in the willpower chapter.
These are quick actions that take place on your combat round in
addition to your combat action. The cost of these effects is
cumulative - the first costs 1 willpower, the 2nd costs 2, third 3,
etc. The only limit is how much willpower your character brings to
the table. Each effect corresponds to one of your attributes and
can be bought with the appropriate willpower points. They can be
purchased before or after your combat action.

Hulk Up - Strength

    Each hulk up adds 1 to your melee combat check for next round.
    After the first point, this becomes less and less economical but
    allows you to go and beyond what other characters are capable of in
    melee, as it does not count toward the point limit on your attack.
    Hulk up is considered weaker than the other combat effects, but
    that's to make up for Strength being the melee attribute.

Step - Agility

    Step allows you to move 1 square. Ordinarily you can move or
    attack during your turn - this option lets you move to your
    opponent and attack in the same turn.

Know Thine Enemy - Brains

    Choose another combatant and any skill or attribute to learn
    its value. Continued uses of Know Thine Enemy will show you your
    enemy's strengths and weaknesses. Note that some abilities may
    allow someone to mask their skills and attributes.

Order - Social

    Giving orders to your teammates allows them to use combat
    effects during your turn. Note that teammate actions will count
    towards point costs. So on player A's turn, he can spend 1 social
    point to Order Player B to Step. Player B then spends 2 agility
    points to move 1 square. Play returns to A, who can spend 3 points
    on another combat effect.


Wounds
------

Hit/dodge/parry is a normal skill.  When someone hits, get their margin of victory.
If that value is above the defense value (armor plus health) for the targeted area,
that limb is wounded.  If the value is greater than a character's total remaining health points,
knocked out.  

To use a wounded body part requires 3 willpower points be spent.  So if you tag
someone's shield arm, and they continue to use the shield, eventually it'll make them pass out.

Magic
=====

Strength - Earth
Agility - Fire
Social - Water
Brains - Air

All have basic elemental effects.  Some buffs too.

Earth/Fire
Earth/Water   healing?
Earth/Air

Fire/Water
Fire/Air

Water/Air     Illusion


Using something nearby is cheap.  Conjuring it up is not.  Air has it easy.
All have buffs
