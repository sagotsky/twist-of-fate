This is a pen and paper RPG, not a software project.  

Twist of Fate (working title) abandons dice as a resolution mechanic.  Instead each player has willpower points that can be bid in order to control the narrative.  I'm hoping this results in a game with more player agency and story focus and all that, but haven't gotten to playtest it yet, so who knows?
