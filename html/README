Interactive HTML character sheet for Twist of Fate.

It has always bothered me when RPG character sheets are different than the interactive versions.  Instead, I'm making one canonical character sheet that just so happens to be slightly interactive.  I would love to incorporate game rules into the sheet, but I'll need more solid rules before that's worth the effort.
